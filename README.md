Imdb-Web-Scraping
To run the project you must install the following packages in the project folder:

pip install bs4

pip install lxml

After installation you can open the cmd in the path of the folder and run the following command for help:

python main.py -h

optional arguments:

  -h, --help                             show this help message and exit
  
  -m , --movie_title                       Name of the movie
  
  -p , --file_path                        Path of the file
  

In addition I will attach an exact example of how to run the project through command line tool:

python main.py -m "star trek" -p C:\Users\TOM\OneDrive\Documents\ScrapingIMDB


Thanks! and enjoy
